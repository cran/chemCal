\title{Toluene amounts measured by GC/MS as reported by Rocke and Lorenzato (1995)}
\description{
  Dataset reproduced from Table 4 in Rocke and Lorenzato (1995). The toluene
  amount in the calibration samples is given in picograms per 100 ÂµL.
  Presumably this is the volume that was injected into the instrument.
}
\format{
  A dataframe containing four replicate observations for each
  of the six calibration standards.
