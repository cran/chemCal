Description: Simple functions for plotting linear
	calibration functions and estimating standard errors for measurements
	according to the Handbook of Chemometrics and Qualimetrics: Part A
	by Massart et al. (1997) There are also functions estimating the limit
	of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ).
	The functions work on model objects from - optionally weighted - linear
	regression (lm) or robust linear regression ('rlm' from the 'MASS' package).
